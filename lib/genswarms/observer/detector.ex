defmodule Genswarms.Observer.Detector do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for pluggable health detectors run by `Genswarms.Observer.DetectorRunner`.

  A detector is pure and synchronous: given the same `fetched` data and
  `ctx`, `detect/2` always returns the same `{alerts, state}`. Isolation
  (crash/timeout containment, thresholds overlay, state-commit-on-success
  only) is the runner's job — a detector never needs to guard against its
  own failure.
  """

  @typedoc """
  One tick's fetch of the observed swarm, as assembled by `Objects.Scope`:

  - `:dashboard` — `GET /api/swarms/:name/dashboard` envelope.
  - `:events` — `GET /api/swarms/:name/events`, the engine-raw LogStore
    surface (string keys, ISO8601 `"timestamp"`). Consumed by the legacy
    health detectors (`Genswarms.Observer.Detectors`).
  - `:feed` — `GET /api/swarms/:name/events/feed`, the host's DISPLAY event
    feed (cursor read; Scope threads the per-swarm cursor). This is where
    the `request_open`/`reply_sent`/... vocabulary lives — string keys,
    `"ts"` float unix seconds. `:unavailable` mirrors the wire's
    `source: "unavailable"` (host has no EventsSource — legitimate, not an
    error); detectors consuming the feed must treat `:unavailable` and
    `{:error, _}` as a no-op with prior state.
